This is a portifolio project composed of a Node.js server/REST API and a React frontend. 
You can create an account, browse, save and download your favorite paintings. 
Saved paintings will appear in your profile, and you can group them into collections.

The number of paintings is unfortunatly limited since I'm only one person working on this, but the intended website experience is available.

How to run: 
  frontend: npm run dev
  backend: npm run start:dev
